# McModSwitch
Switcher for old mod packs that need the .minecraft folder

I wrote this because I really wanted to play the original YogBox but if you get YogBox from the technic launcher nowadays it's broken, for some reason the Mo' creature sounds does not work and I couldn't find how to fix it online, but I found a backed up version of YogBox online that comes with a cracked launcher that fully works.

But this version requires the .minecraft folder and so I tought I can't play vanilla and YogBox.

I didn't tried combining the vanilla folder and YogBox one.

but I wrote this script that does switch the folders for me I just make two shortcuts one with -v for Vanilla and the other with -y for YogBox

dependencies to run this for yourself:
 - ruby
 - 7zip (added to path so it can be called from command line)
