# McModSwitch
Switcher for old mod packs that need the .minecraft folder

the code is now hard coded to my pc but like if you are not 12 you can make it work on your own.<br>
Sorry I like whipped this up in like and hour while I was in a call with a friend so like cut me some slack.<br>
I works afterall you know?
